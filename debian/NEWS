rdiff-backup (2.0.5-2) unstable; urgency=medium

    The network protocol of versions 1 and 2 of rdiff-backup are incompatible.
    This means that you must be running the same version (either 1 or 2) of
    rdiff-backup locally and remotely. Since Buster ships version 1.2.8 and
    Bullseye ships version 2.0.5, upgrading only the local system or only the
    remote system from Buster to Bullseye will break rdiff-backup runs between
    the two.

    For conveniency, version 2.0.5 of rdiff-backup is available in the
    buster-backports distribution, see https://backports.debian.org/
    This allows to first upgrade only the rdiff-backup package on Buster
    systems, and then independently upgrade systems to Bullseye at your
    convenience.
